# Contribution Guidelines

In ToolPool, tools are divided among various categories.

## Praposing new category/tool

1. If you want to prapose a whole new category/tool in ToolPool, first raise an issue for it from [category-request](https://github.com/harshptl14/toolpool/issues/new?assignees=&labels=category-request&template=category-request.md&title=) and [tool-request](https://github.com/harshptl14/toolpool/issues/new?assignees=&labels=tool-request&template=tool-request.md&title=) respectively.
2. Once everything is discussed and the category/tool is approved, we'll provide a new logo for category/tool
3. Then you can start working/coding on it.

<summary><strong>How to add new category in existing list?</strong></summary>

1. Create a new branch with `{categoryname}` _(ex. texttools)_ from master
2. Move to `.\static\utils\config.js`
3. In `config` map variable, find the `categoryList` and add the new category details (name, logo, id _(must be in camelCase)_, key _(increment according to last category in list)_ ) at the end according to below format.

```javascript
{
    name: "{CATEGORYNAME}",
    logo: "ADD ANY LOGO FOR JUST TESTING PURPOSE, WE'LL UPDATE THIS LATER",
    id: "{CATEGORYNAME} in camelCase",
    key:{INCREMENT ACCORDING TO LAST CATEGORY IN LIST}
}
```

4. In same `config` map, at the end add a key-value pair with key as **Category name in camelCase** and a list as value which will contain details of tools of that category._(see other category listed in map)_
5. After that move to `.\components\Tools\`
6. Create a new folder with category name in TitleCase
7. Inside that folder you can create folders for new tools

_Note: New category will get listed in `master` only after at least one tool is there(in working condition) for that category_

<summary><strong>Styling in Toolpool</strong></summary>
  <br/>
To start with, the styles directory holds most of the properties of the design system. You can find common queries regarding the usage of the style system below.

1.  How to access colors based on Theme?
    
    -   [Theme](styles/theme.js) wraps the [whole app](components/Layout.js), so itâ€™s accessible throughout the application.
        
        To access the theme, use this syntax
        
        ```jsx
        ${({ theme }) => theme.color};
        ```
        
        Colors and styled will be applied according to currently active theme i.e. Light/Dark.
        
        [Theme.js](styles/theme.js) contains the variables for both light and dark theme.
        
2.  How to access styles of different custom components?
    
    -   To access styles of commanly used custom components, checkout [styles/mixins.js](styles/mixins.js)
        To access components, use this syntax
        
        ```jsx
        ${({ theme }) => theme.mixins.smallButton};
        ```
        
        Add custom styles which are going to be used widely in the project in [mixins.js](styles/mixins.js) file.
