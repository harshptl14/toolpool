## What is this?
**Whitespace Remover** is a tool to remove all unwanted multiple whitespaces and line-breaks from a text.

export const CSSTransitionsReadme = `
## What is CSS Transition Generator?

CSS Transition Generator is an online tool to generate css code for various types of transition animations for properties like width, height, outline, background-color and opacity.

You can set values for different properties for an element and also change the duration and delay of the transition. 

**Transition syntax explanation:**

The first parameter defines which CSS3 property will be affected by the transition (ex. outline, width, etc.).

The second parameter defines the duration in seconds (s) of the transition. In our example the duration is 1 seconds.

The third parameter (optional) is the speed curve of the transition. Below are some functions that can be used:
- ease: specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then slow. It is the default value.
- linear: specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to the end.
- ease-in: specifies a transition effect with a slow start.
- ease-out: specifies a transition effect with a slow end.
- ease-in-out: specifies a transition effect with a slow start and a slow end.

We can also add a delay (optional), in order to shift the transition according to a duration.

First code snippets is for the initial state of the element and the seconds snippet is for the pseudo class like hover, click, etc. of the element.

Example:

.box {\n
    opacity: 0.5;
    transition: opacity 1s ease 0s;
}

.box:hover {\n
    opacity: 1;
}

export const SizeConverterReadme = `

# What is a Size Converter

CSS has four different units that can be used to denote the size of fonts (and other elements such as margins). The application and relationships between these units can be very confusing, so this tool will help to convert em to px, pt to px, etc.

## ****Px, em, pt, and %****

- **Pixels (px)** are fixed-size units that correspond to the resolution of the screen - one pixel is the smallest "dot" that can be accurately displayed on the screen. Choosing this unit will result in a perfectly sharp and visible font on the screen, regardless of what kind of display you will use. The only drawback is that fonts expressed in these units cannot scale (but it is possible to use the zoom feature of web browsers to enlarge the text).

- **Ems (em)** are scalable units, used in digital media. One em corresponds to the height of the current font; for example, if the font used has a height of 12 pt, then 1 em = 12 pt. Ems are a popular unit because they are easy to understand, can be scaled if desired, and are mobile-device friendly. The main drawback of ems is the threat of cascading - because this unit is relative, changing the height of the "parent" text immediately resizes all other fonts.

- **Points (pt)** are a unit for print CSS only. One point is equal to 1/72 inch, but only after printing. 1 pt will look differently across devices or web browsers, as it will depend on screen resolution. Points are not scalable and should be avoided in digital media.

- **Percentage (%)** is very similar to the em unit. The main difference is that 1 em = 100%. This unit is perfectly scalable and allows for zooming in and out. Similarly to ems, they can cause cascading.

## **Conversion**

Follow these simple steps to convert between CSS units quickly and effortlessly:

1. Set a base value. By default, this is 16 px.
2. Determine the size of your font in any of the units.
3. The px to em calculator will find its equivalent in other units, according to these rules:
    - 1 point is equal to 0.75 pixels;
    - 1 em is equal to the size in pixels divided by the base value;
    - 1 em is equal to 100%.

## **Example: Converting pt to px, em and %**

Let's assume that you want to convert 24 pt to px, assuming the base size of 16 px. You can find it in the following way:

1. If \`1pt = 0.75 px\`, then \`1px = 1.33 pt\`. Hence, 24pt is equivalent to \`1.33 * 24 = 32px\`.
2. When finding the equivalent in ems, we need to divide the size in pixels by the base size: \`32px / 16px = 2em\`.
3. As \`1em = 100%\`, \`2em = 200%\`.

export const RgbHexConverterReadme = `
# What is this tool?

RGBA-HEX-HSL Converter is a **free online tool for converting various color formats into another format**. There are different color formats to define a color in CSS. Some are HEX (Hexadecimal Colors), RGB & RGBA, HSL & HSLA.

The most used color formats are HEX and RGBA. HEX stands for hexadecimal colors while RGBA stands for "red, green, blue, alpha". HEX color code may have varying character lengths with a maximum of 8 without a # sign. The first 6 characters show the amount of red, green, and blue. There are 2 hexadecimal characters for each color. Each character may vary within 0-9 & a-f which means a total of 16 possibilities. For 2 characters, it means 256 possibilities. If you use an 8-character length HEX code, the last 2 characters symbolize the alpha of the color. In RGBA color format, there are 4 arguments. The first 3 is red, green, and blue which is varying between 0 to 255 and the last one is the alpha (or opacity) which varies from 0 to 1.

For the example in the image, if you convert each hexadecimal pair to decimals, 00 => 0, 52 => 82, cc => 204, you will get the RGB colors. Since HEX color is 6 characters only, alpha is equal to 1.

## **How to use Online HEX to RGBA Converter?**

You can convert the formate of input color by following these steps.

1. First, enter the HEX-RGBA-HSL code you want to convert to another format in the input area.
2. Click the convert button. If the code you entered is valid, the code will pop, otherwise, you will see an error. You can also use the color picker directly, then you don't need to use the Convert button since it automatically fills both color codes.
3. You can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on a value.
